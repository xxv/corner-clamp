Corner clamp
============

This can help clamp a small rectangular box for gluing.
It has a circular cutout so glue doesn't get on the clamp.

Usage
-----

Print 4 copies of the clamp.

Using a piece of string, loop it through the holes in the clamps and then make
it taut by wrapping it around a scrap of material with notches cut into it and
twirling it.
